Sem1-4 Advanced Security Assignment


1. In this part you will be required to list Cryptographic applications you will use to lock
down the web browser you are using. In other words, how will you make your browser
more secure, so that it mitigates the exposure of your personally identifiable information
and any other data you may wish to protect? List the applications you will install in your
browser to show who is tracking you. Why are you being tracked in every click you
make? Is it possible to prevent being tracked? If yes, why or if no why not? Do not write
more than one a page.

2. Write a program that will implement Caesar Cipher.
You can use Java or any other programming language.
You can use online cryptographs tools (http://www.cryptool.org/en/) to check the
accuracy of your programs. Please note that there are a lot of tools you may use to
complete this part, just search on the Web.


3. The following information was encrypted using Caesar Cipher. Using your own program,
Decrypt it.

4. Write a program that will implement Vigeneré Cipher. You can encrypt the word
“explanation” using the key leg. You can use Java or any other programming language


5. Write a Java program (or any other programming language you are happy to use) to
encrypt and decrypt plaintext using a 2 x 2 Hill cipher.
